<p id="id00059" style="margin-top: 4em">Stories of Gods and Heroes.</p>

<h3 id="id00060" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter I</h3>

<p id="id00061">Introduction</p>

<p id="id00062">The literature of our time, as of all the centuries of
Christendom, is full of allusions to the gods and goddesses of
the Greeks and Romans.  Occasionally, and, in modern days, more
often, it contains allusions to the worship and the superstitions
of the northern nations of Europe.  The object of this book is to
teach readers who are not yet familiar with the writers of Greece
and Rome, or the ballads or legends of the Scandinavians, enough
of the stories which form what is called their mythology, to make
those allusions intelligible which one meets every day, even in
the authors of our own time.</p>

<p id="id00063">The Greeks and Romans both belong to the same race or stock.  It
is generally known in our time as the Aryan family of mankind;
and so far as we know its history, the Greeks and Romans
descended from the tribes which emigrated from the high table-
lands of Northern India.  Other tribes emigrated in different
directions from the same centre, so that traces of the Aryan
language are found in the islands of the Pacific ocean.</p>

<p id="id00064">The people of this race, who moved westward, seem to have had a
special fondness for open air nature, and a willingness to
personify the powers of nature.  They were glad to live in the
open air, and they specially encouraged the virtues which an
open-air people prize.  Thus no Roman was thought manly who could
not swim, and every Greek exercised in the athletic sports of the
palaestra.</p>

<p id="id00065">The Romans and Grecian and German divisions of this great race
are those with which we have most to do in history and in
literature.  Our own English language is made up of the dialects
of different tribes, many of whom agreed in their use of words
which they had derived from our Aryan ancestry.  Thus our
substantive verb I AM appears in the original Sanscrit of the
Aryans as ESMI, and m for ME (MOI), or the first person singular,
is found in all the verbal inflections.  The Greek form of the
same verb was ESMI, which became ASMI,   and in Latin the first
and last vowels have disappeared, the verb is SUM.  Similar
relationships are traced in the numerals, and throughout all the
languages of these nations.</p>

<p id="id00066">The Romans, like the Etruscans who came before them, were neither
poetical nor imaginative in temperament.  Their activity ran in
practical directions.  They therefore invented few, if any
stories, of the gods whom they worshipped with fixed rites.  Mr.
Macaulay speaks of these gods as "the sober abstractions of the
Roman pantheon."  We owe most of the stories of the ancient
mythology to the wit and fancy of the Greeks,   more playful and
imaginative,   who seized from Egypt and from the East such
legends as pleased them,   and adapted them in their own way.  It
often happens that such stories, resembling each other in their
foundation, are found in the Greek and Roman authors in several
different forms.</p>

<p id="id00067">To understand these stories, we will here first acquaint
ourselves with the ideas of the structure of the universe, which
the poets and others held, and which will form the scenery, so to
speak, of the narratives.</p>

<p id="id00068">The Greek poets believed the earth to be flat and circular, their
own country occupying the middle of it, the central point being
either Mount Olympus, the abode of the gods, or Delphi, so famous
for its oracle.</p>

<p id="id00069">The circular disk of the earth was crossed from west to east, and
divided into two equal parts by the SEA, as they called the
Mediterranean, and its continuation the Euxine.</p>

<p id="id00070">Around the earth flowed the RIVER OCEAN, its course being from
south to north on the western side of the earth, and in a
contrary direction on the eastern side.  It flowed in a steady,
equable current, unvexed by storm or tempest.  The sea, and all
the rivers on earth, received their waters from it.</p>

<p id="id00071">The northern portion of the earth was supposed to be inhabited by
a happy race named the Hyperboreans [this word means "who live
beyond the north" from the word "hyper," beyond, and boreas, the
north wind], dwelling in everlasting bliss and spring beyond the
lofty mountains whose caverns were supposed to send forth the
piercing blasts of the north wind, which chilled the people of
Hellas (Greece).  Their country was inaccessible by land or sea.
They lived exempt from disease or old age, from toils and
warfare.  Moore has given us the "Song of a Hyperborean,"
beginning</p>

<p id="id00072">  "I come from a land in the sun-bright deep,<br/>

  Where golden gardens glow,<br/>

  Where the winds of the north, becalmed in sleep,<br/>

  Their conch-shells never blow."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00073">On the south side of the earth, close to the stream of Ocean,
dwelt a people happy and virtuous as the Hyperboreans.  They were
named the AEthiopians.  The gods favored them so highly that they
were wont to leave at times their Olympian abodes, and go to
share their sacrifices and banquets.</p>

<p id="id00074">On the western margin of the earth, by the stream of Ocean, lay a
happy place named the Elysian Plain, whither mortals favored by
the gods were transported without tasting of death, to enjoy an
immortality of bliss.  This happy region was also called the
"fortunate fields," and the "Isles of the Blessed."</p>

<p id="id00075">We thus see that the Greeks of the early ages knew little of any
real people except those to the east and south of their own
country, or near the coast of the Mediterranean.  Their
imagination meantime peopled the western portion of this sea with
giants, monsters, and enchantresses; while they placed around the
disk of the earth, which they probably regarded as of no great
width, nations enjoying the peculiar favor of the gods, and
blessed with happiness and longevity.</p>

<p id="id00076">The Dawn, the Sun, and the Moon were supposed to rise out of the
Ocean, on the western side, and to drive through the air, giving
light to gods and men.  The stars also, except those forming
Charles' Wain or Bear, and others near them, rose out of and sank
into the stream of Ocean.  There the sun-god embarked in a winged
boat, which conveyed him round by the northern part of the earth,
back to his place of rising in the east.  Milton alludes to this
in his "Commmus."</p>

<p id="id00077">  "Now the gilded car of day<br/>

  His golden axle doth allay<br/>

  In the steep Atlantic stream,<br/>

  And the slope sun his upward beam<br/>

  Shoots against the dusky pole,<br/>

  Pacing towards the other goal<br/>

  Of his chamber in the east."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00078">The abode of the gods was on the summit of Mount Olympus, in
Thessaly.  A gate of clouds, kept by the goddesses named the
Seasons, opened to permit the passage of the Celestials to earth,
and to receive them on their return.  The gods had their separate
dwellings; but all, when summoned, repaired to the palace of
Jupiter [Or Zeus.  The relation of these names to each other will
be explained on the next page], as did also those deities whose
usual abode was the earth, the waters, or the underworld.  It was
also in the great hall of the palace of the Olympian king that
the gods feasted each day on ambrosia and nectar, their food and
drink, the latter being handed round by the lovely goddess Hebe.
Here they conversed of the affairs of heaven and earth; and as
they quaffed their nectar, Apollo, the god of music, delighted
them with the tones of his lyre, to which the muses sang in
responsive strains.  When the sun was set, the gods retired to
sleep in their respective dwellings.</p>

<p id="id00079">The following lines from the Odyssey will show how Homer
conceived of Olympus:—</p>

<p id="id00080">  "So saying, Minerva, goddess azure-eyed,<br/>

  Rose to Olympus, the reputed seat<br/>

  Eternal of the gods, which never storms<br/>

  Disturb, rains drench, or snow invades, but calm<br/>

 The expanse and cloudless shines with purest day.<br/>

  T here the inhabitants divine rejoice<br/>

  Forever.:" Cowper<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00081">Such were the abodes of the gods as the Greeks conceived them.
The Romans, before they knew the Greek poetry, seem to have had
no definite imagination of such an assembly of gods.  But the
Roman and Etruscan races were by no means irreligious.  They
venerated their departed ancestors,   and in each family the
worship of these ancestors was an important duty.  The images of
the ancestors were kept in a sacred place,   each family
observed, at fixed times, memorial rites in their honor,   and
for these and other religious observances the family hearth was
consecrated.  The earliest rites of Roman worship are supposed to
be connected with such family devotions.</p>

<p id="id00082">As the Greeks and Romans became acquainted with other nations,
they imported their habits of worship, even in early times.  It
will be remembered that as late as St. Paul's time, he found an
altar at Athens "to an unknown god."  Greeks and Romans alike
were willing to receive from other nations the legends regarding
their gods, and to incorporate them as well as they could with
their own.  It is thus that in the poetical mythology of those
nations, which we are now to study, we frequently find a Latin
and a Greek name for one imagined divinity.  Thus Zeus, of the
Greeks, becomes in Latin   with the addition of the word pater (a
father) [The reader will observe that father is one of the words
derived from an Ayan root.  Let p and t become rough, as the
grammarians say,   let p become ph, and t th, and you have
phather or father], Jupiter   Kronos of the Greeks appears as
"Vulcanus" of the Latins, "Ares" of the Greeks is "Mars" or
Mavors of the Latins, "Poseidon" of the Greeks is "Neptunus" of
the Latins, "Aphrodite" of the Greeks is "Venus" of the Latins.
This variation is not to be confounded with a mere translation,
as where "Paulos" of the Greek becomes "Paulus" in Latin, or
"Odysseus" becomes "Ulysses,"   or as when "Pierre" of the French
becomes "Peter" in English.  What really happened was, that as
the Romans, more cultivated than their fathers, found in Greek
literature a god of fire and smithery,   they transferred his
name "Hephaistos" to their own old god "Vulcanus,"   who had the
same duties,   and in their after literature the Latin name was
used for the stories of Greek and Latin origin.</p>

<p id="id00083">As the English literature came into being largely on French and
Latin models, and as French is but a degraded Latin and retains
Latin roots largely,   in our older English poets the Latin forms
of these names are generally used.  In our own generation, with
the precision now so much courted, a fashion has come in, of
designating Mars by his Greek name of "Ares," Venus by her name
of "Aphrodite," and so on.  But in this book, as our object is to
make familiar the stores of general English literature which
refer to such subjects, we shall retain, in general, the Latin
names,   only calling the attention of the reader to the Greek
names, as they appear in Greek authors,   and in many writers of
the more recent English schools.</p>

<p id="id00084">The real monarch of the heavens in the mythology of both Greece
and Rome is Jupiter (Zeus-pater, father-Jove) [Jove appears to be
a word derived from the same root as Zeus, and it appears in the
root dev of the Sanscrit, where devas are gods of different
forms.  Our English word devil probably comes from the French
diable, Italian diavolo, Latin diabolus, one who makes division,-
- literally one who separates balls, or throws balls about,—
instead of throwing them frankly and truly at the batsman.  It is
not to be traced to the Sanscrit deva.]</p>

<p id="id00085">In the mythological system we are tracing Zeus is himself the
father of many of the gods, and he is often spoken of as father
of gods and men.  He is the father of Vulcan [In Greek
Hephaistos], of Venus [in Greek Aphrodite], of Minerva [in Greek
Pallas Athene, or either name separately], of Apollo [of
Phoebus], Diana [in Greek Artemis], and of Mercury [in Greek
Hermes], who are ranked among the twelve superior gods, and of
many inferior deities.  But Jupiter himself is not the original
deity in these systems.  He is the son of Saturnus, as in the
Greek Zeus is the son of Kronos.  Still the inevitable question
would occur where did Saturnus or Kronos come from.  And, in
forms and statements more and more vague, the answer was that he
was born from Uranus or Ouranos, which is the name of the Heaven
over all which seemed to embrace all things.  The Greek name of
Saturn was spelled Kronos.  The Greek name of Time was spelled
Chronos.  A similarity between the two was imagined.  And the
whole statement, when reduced to rationalistic language, would be
that from Uranus, the infinite, was born Chronos, Time,— that
from Time, Zeus or Jupiter was born, and that he is the only
child of Time who has complete sway over mortals and immortals.</p>

<p id="id00086">  "The will of Jove I own,<br/>

  Who mortals and immortals rules alone."<br/>

  Homer, II.xii<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00087">Jupiter was son of Saturn (Kronos) [The names included in
parentheses are the Greek, the others being the Roman or Latin
names] and Ops (Rhea in Greek, sometimes confounded with the
Phrygian Cybele).</p>

<p id="id00088">Saturn and Rhea were of the race of Titans, who were the children
of Earth and Heaven, which sprang from Chaos, of which we shall
give a further account in our next chapter.</p>

<p id="id00089">In allusion to the dethronement of Ouranos by Kronos, and of<br/>

Kronos or Saturnus by Zeus or Jupiter, Prometheus says in<br/>

AEschylus's tragedy,—<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00090">  "You may deem<br/>

  Its towers impregnable; but have I not<br/>

  already seen two monarchs hurled from them."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00091">Thee is another cosmogony, or account of the creation, according
to which Earth, Erebus, and Love were the first of beings.  Love
(Eros)_ issued from the egg of Night, which floated on Chaos.  By
his arrows and torch he pierced and vivified all things,
producing life and joy.</p>

<p id="id00092">Saturn and Rhea were not the only Titans.  There were others,
whose names were Oceanus, Hyperion, Iapetus, and Ophion, males;
and Themis, Mnemosyne, Eurynome, females.  They are spoken of as
the elder gods, whose dominion was afterwards transferred to
others.  Saturn yielded to Jupiter, Oceanus to Neptune, Hyperion
to Apollo.  Hyperion was the father of the Sun, Moon, and Dawn.
He is therefore the original sun-god, and is painted with the
splendor and beauty which were afterwards bestowed on Apollo.</p>

<p id="id00093">"Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself."   Shakespeare</p>

<p id="id00094">Ophion and Eurynome ruled over Olympus till they were dethroned
by Saturn and Rhea.  Milton alludes to them in Paradise Lost.  He
says the heathen seem to have had some knowledge of the
temptation and fall of man,—</p>

<p id="id00095">  "And fabled how the serpent, whom they called<br/>

  Ophion, with Eurynome (the wide-<br/>

  Encroaching Eve perhaps), had first the rule<br/>

  Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driven."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00096">The representations given of Saturn are not very consistent, for
on the one hand his reign is said to have been the golden age of
innocence and purity, and on the other he is described as a
monster who devoured his own children [This inconsistency arises
from considering the Saturn of the Romans the same with the
Grecian deity Chronos (Time), which, as it brings an end to all
things which have had a beginning, may be said to devour its own
offspring.] Jupiter, however, escaped this fate, and when grown
up espoused Metis (Prudence), who administered a draught to
Saturn which caused him to disgorge his children.  Jupiter, with
his brothers and sisters, now rebelled against their father
Saturn, and his brothers the Titans; vanquished them, and
imprisoned some of them in Tartarus, inflicting other penalties
on others.  Atlas was condemned to bear up the heavens on his
shoulders.</p>

<p id="id00097">On the dethronement of Saturn, Jupiter with his brothers Neptune
(Poseidon) and Pluto (Dis) divided his dominions.  Jupiter's
portion was the heavens, Neptune's the ocean, and Pluto's the
realms of the dead.  Earth and Olympus were common property.
Jupiter was king of gods and men.  The thunder was his weapon,
and he bore a shield called AEgis, made for him by Vulcan.  The
eagle was his favorite bird, and bore his thunderbolts.</p>

<p id="id00098">Juno (Hera)[pronounce He-re, in two syllables] was the wife of
Jupiter, and queen of the gods.  Iris, the goddess of the
rainbow, was her attendant and messenger.  The peacock was her
favorite bird.</p>

<p id="id00099">Vulcan (Hephaistos), the celestial artist, was the son of Jupiter
and Juno.  He was born lame, and his mother was so displeased at
the sight of him that she flung him out of heaven.  Other
accounts say that Jupiter kicked him out for taking part with his
mother, in a quarrel which occurred between them.  Vulcan's
lameness, according to this account, was the consequence of his
fall.  He was a whole day falling, and at last alighted in the
island of Lemnos, which was thenceforth sacred to him.  Milton
alludes to this story in Paradise lost, Book I.</p>

<p id="id00100">  "From morn<br/>

  To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,<br/>

  A summer's day; and with the setting sun<br/>

  Dropped from the zenith, like a falling star,<br/>

  On Lemnos, the AEgean isle."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00101">Mars (Ares), the god of war, was the son of Jupiter and Juno.
Phoebus Apollo [this is a Greek name of a Greek divinity, who
seems to have had no Roman resemblance], the god of archery,
prophecy, and music, was the son of Jupiter and Latona, and
brother of Diana (Artemis).  He was god of the sun, as Diana, his
sister, was the goddess of the moon.</p>

<p id="id00102">Venus (Aphrodite), the goddess of love and beauty, was the
daughter of Jupiter and Dione.  Others say that Venus sprang from
the foam of the sea.  The zephyr wafted her along the waves to
the Isle of Cyprus, where she was received and attired by the
Seasons, and then led to the assembly of the gods.  All were
charmed with her beauty, and each one demanded her for his wife.
Jupiter gave her to Vulcan, in gratitude for the service he had
rendered in forging thunderbolts.  So the most beautiful of the
goddesses became the wife of the most ill-favored of the gods.
Venus possessed an embroidered girdle called the Cestus, which
had the power of inspiring love.  Her favorite birds were swans
and doves, and the plants sacred to her were the rose and the
myrtle.</p>

<p id="id00103">Cupid (Eros), the god of love, was the son of Venus.  He was her
constant companion; and, armed with bow and arrows, he shot the
darts of desire into the bosoms of both gods and men.  There was
a deity named Anteros, who was sometimes represented as the
avenger of slighted love, and sometimes as the symbol of
reciprocal affection.  The following legend is told of him:—</p>

<p id="id00104">Venus, complaining to Themis that her son Eros continued always a
child, was told by her that it was because he was solitary, and
that if he had a brother he would grow apace.  Anteros was soon
afterwards born, and Eros immediately was seen to increase
rapidly in size and strength.</p>

<p id="id00105">Minerva (Pallas Athene), the goddess of wisdom, was the offspring
of Jupiter, without a mother.  She sprang from his head,
completely armed.  Her favorite bird was the owl, and the plant
sacred to her the olive.</p>

<p id="id00106">Byron, in "Childe Harold," alludes to the birth of Minerva thus:—</p>

<p id="id00107">  "Can tyrants but by tyrants conquered be,<br/>

  And freedom find no champion and no child,<br/>

  Such as Columbia saw arise, when she<br/>

  Sprang forth a Pallas, armed and undefiled?<br/>

  Or must such minds be nourished in the wild,<br/>

  Deep in the unpruned forest, 'midst the roar<br/>

  Of Cataracts, where nursing Nature smiled<br/>

  On infant Washington?  Has earth no more<br/>

  Such seeds within her breast, or Europe no such shore?"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00108">Mercury (Hermes), was the son of Jupiter and Maia.  He presided
over commerce, wrestling and other gymnastic exercises; even over
thieving, and everything, in short, which required skill and
dexterity.  He was the messenger of Jupiter, and wore a winged
cap and winged shoes.  He bore in his hand a rod entwined with
two serpents, called the Caduceus.</p>

<p id="id00109">Mercury is said to have invented the lyre.  Four hours after his
birth he found the shell of a tortoise, made holes in the
opposite edges of it, and drew cords of linen through them, and
the instrument was complete [From this origin of the instrument,
the word "shell" is often used as synonymous with :"lyre," and
figuratively for music and poetry.  Thus Gray, in his ode on the
"Progress of Poesy," says,— "O Sovereign of the willing soul,
Parent of sweet and solemn-breathing airs, Enchanting shell! The
sullen Cares And Frantic Passions hear thy soft control."] The
cords were nine, in honor of the nine Muses.  Mercury gave the
lyre to Apollo, and received from him in exchange the caduceus.</p>

<p id="id00110">Ceres (Demeter) was the daughter of Saturn and Rhea.  She had a
daughter named Proserpine (Persephone), who became the wife of
Pluto, and queen of the realms of the dead.  Ceres presided over
agriculture.</p>

<p id="id00111">Bacchus (Dionysus)_, the god of wine, was the son of Jupiter and
Semele.  He represents not only the intoxicating power of wine,
but its social and beneficent influences likewise; so that he is
viewed as the promoter of civilization, and a lawgiver and lover
of peace.</p>

<p id="id00112">The muses were the daughters of Jupiter and Mnemosyne (Memory).
They presided over song, and prompted the memory.  They were nine
in number, to each of whom was assigned the presidency over some
particular department of literature, art, or science.  Calliope
was the muse of epic poetry, Clio of history, Euterpe of lyric
poetry, Melpomene of tragedy, Terpischore of choral dance and
song, Erato of love-poetry, Polyhymnia of sacred poetry, Urania
of astronomy, Thalia [Pronounced Tha-lei-a, with the emphasis on
the second syllable] of comedy.</p>

<p id="id00113">Spenser described the office of the Graces thus:—</p>

<p id="id00114">  "These three on men all gracious gifts bestow<br/>

  Which deck the body or adorn the mind,<br/>

  To make them lovely or well-favored show;<br/>

  As comely carriage, entertainment kind,<br/>

  Sweet semblance, friendly offices that bind,<br/>

  And all the compliments of courtesy;<br/>

  They teach us how to each degree and kind<br/>

  We should ourselves demean, to low, to high.<br/>

  To friends, to foes; which skill men call Civility."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00115">The Fates were also three   Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos.  Their
office was to spin the thread of human destiny, and they were
armed with shears, with which they cut it off when they pleased.
They were the daughters of Themis (Law), who sits by Jove on his
throne to give him counsel.</p>

<p id="id00116">The Erinnyes, or Furies, were three goddesses who punished crimes
by their secret stings.  The heads of the Furies were wreathed
with serpents, and their whole appearance was terrific and
appalling.  Their names were Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megaera.
They were also called Eumenides.</p>

<p id="id00117">Nemesis was also an avenging goddess.  She represents the
righteous anger of the gods, particularly towards the proud and
insolent.</p>

<p id="id00118">Pan [the name Pan means everything, and he is sometimes spoken of<br/>

as the god of all nature] was the god of flocks and shepherds.<br/>

His favorite residence, as the Greeks describe him, was in<br/>

Arcadia.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00119">The Satyrs were deities of the woods and fields.  They were
conceived to be covered with bristly hair, their heads decorated
with short, sprouting horns, and their feet like goats' feet.</p>

<p id="id00120">Momus was the god of laughter, and Plutus the god of wealth.</p>

<h5 id="id00121">ROMAN DIVINITIES</h5>

<p id="id00122">The preceding are Grecian divinities, though received also by the<br/>

Romans.  Those which follow are peculiar to Roman mythology.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00123">Saturn was an ancient Italian deity.  The Roman poets tried to
identify him with the Grecian god Kronos, and fabled that after
his dethronement by Jupiter, he fled to Italy, where he reigned
during what was called the Golden Age.  In memory of his
beneficent dominion, the feast of Saturnalia was held every year
in the winter season.  Then all public business was suspended,
declarations of war and criminal executions were postponed,
friends made presents to one another, and the slaves were
indulged with great liberties.  A feast was given them at which
they sat at table, while their masters served them, to show the
natural equality of men, and that all things belonged equally to
all, in the reign of Saturn.</p>

<p id="id00124">Faunus [there was also a goddess called Fauna, or Bona Dea], the
grandson of Saturn, was worshipped as the god of fields and
shepherds, and also as a prophetic god.  His name in the plural,
Fauns, expressed a class of gamesome deities, like the Satyrs of
the Greeks.</p>

<p id="id00125">Quirinus was a war god, said to be no other than Romulus the
founder of Rome, exalted after his death to a place among the
gods.</p>

<p id="id00126">Bellona, a war goddess.</p>

<p id="id00127">Terminus, the god of landmarks.  His statue was a rude stone or
post, set in the ground to mark the boundaries of fields.</p>

<p id="id00128">Pales, the goddess presiding over cattle and pastures.</p>

<p id="id00129">Pomona presided over fruit trees.</p>

<p id="id00130">Flora, the goddess of flowers.</p>

<p id="id00131">Lucina, the goddess of childbirth.</p>

<p id="id00132">Vesta (the Hestia of the Greeks) was a deity presiding over the
public and private hearth.  A sacred fire, tended by six virgin
priestesses called Vestals, flamed in her temple.  As the safety
of the city was held to be connected with its conservation, the
neglect of the virgins, if they let it go out, was severely
punished, and the fire was rekindled from the rays of the sun.</p>

<p id="id00133">Liber is another Latin name of Bacchus; and Mulciber of Vulcan.</p>

<p id="id00134">Janus was the porter of heaven.  He opens the year, the first
month being named after him.  He is the guardian deity of gates,
on which account he is commonly represented with two heads,
because every door looks two ways.  His temples at Rome were
numerous.  In war time the gates of the principal one were always
open.  In peace they were closed; but they were shut only once
between the reign of Numa and that of Augustus.</p>

<p id="id00135">The Penates were the gods who were supposed to attend to the
welfare and prosperity of the family.  Their name is derived from
Penus, the pantry, which was sacred to them.  Every master of a
family was the priest to the Penates of his own house.</p>

<p id="id00136">The Lares, or Lars, were also household gods, but differed from
the Penates in being regarded as the deified spirits of mortals.
The family Lars were held to be the souls of the ancestors, who
watched over and protected their descendants.  The words Lemur
and Larva more nearly correspond to our word Ghost.</p>

<p id="id00137">The Romans believed that every man had his Genius, and every
woman her Juno; that is, a spirit who had given them being, and
was regarded as a protector through life.  On birthdays men made
offerings to their Genius, women to their Juno.</p>

<p id="id00138">Macaulay thus alludes to some of the Roman gods:—</p>

<p id="id00139">  "Pomona loves the orchard,<br/>

  And Liber loves the vine,<br/>

  And Pales loves the straw-built shed<br/>

  Warm with the breath of kine;<br/>

  And Venus loves the whisper<br/>

  Of plighted youth and maid<br/>

  In April's ivory moonlight,<br/>

  Beneath the Chestnut shade."<br/>

  "Prophecy of Capys."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00140">N.B.  It is to be observed that in proper names the final e and
es are to be sounded.  Thus Cybele and Penates are words of three
syllables.  But Proserpine and Thebes have been so long used as
English words, that they may be regarded as exceptions, to be
pronounced as if English.  Hecate is sometimes pronounced by the
poets as a dissylable.  In the Index at the close of the volume,
we shall mark the accented syllable, in all words which appear to
require it.</p>

<h3 id="id00141" style="margin-top: 3em">CHAPTER II</h3>

<p id="id00142">Prometheus and Pandora</p>

<p id="id00143">The Roman poet Ovid gives us a connected narrative of creation.
Before the earth and sea and the all-covering heaven, one aspect,
which we call Chaos, covered all the face of Nature,— a rough
heap of inert weight and discordant beginnings of things clashing
together.  As yet no sun gave light to the world, nor did the
moon renew her slender horn month by month,— neither did the
earth hang in the surrounding air, poised by its own weight,—
nor did the sea stretch its long arms around the earth.  Wherever
there was earth, there was also sea and air.  So the earth was
not solid nor was the water fluid, neither was the air
transparent.</p>

<p id="id00144">God and Nature at last interposed and put an end to this discord,
separating earth from sea, and heaven from both.  The fiery part,
being the lightest, sprang up, and formed the skies; the air was
next in weight and place.  The earth, being heavier, sank below,
and the water took the lowest place and buoyed up the earth.</p>

<p id="id00145">Here some god, no man knows who, arranged and divided the land.
He placed the rivers and bays, raised mountains and dug out
valleys and distributed woods, fountains, fertile fields and
stony plains.  Now that the air was clear the stars shone out,
the fishes swam the sea and birds flew in the air, while the
four-footed beasts roamed around the earth.  But a nobler animal
was needed, and man was made in the image of the gods with an
upright stature [The two Greek words for man have the root an,
"up], so that while all other animals turn their faces downward
and look to the earth, he raises his face to heaven and gazes on
the stars [Every reader will be interested in comparing this
narrative with that in the beginning of Genesis.  It seems clear
that so many Jews were in Rome in Ovid's days, many of whom were
people of consideration among those with whom he lived, that he
may have heard the account in the Hebrew Scriptures translated.
Compare JUDAISM by Prof. Frederic Huidekoper.]</p>

<p id="id00146">To Prometheus the Titan and to his brother Epimetheus was
committed the task of making man and all other animals, and of
endowing them with all needful faculties.  This Epimetheus did,
and his brother overlooked the work.  Epimetheus then gave to the
different animals their several gifts of courage, strength,
swiftness and sagacity.  He gave wings to one, claws to another,
a shelly covering to the third.  Man, superior to all other
animals, came last.  But for man Epimetheus had nothing,— he had
bestowed all his gifts elsewhere.  He came to his brother for
help, and Prometheus, with the aid of Minerva, went up to heaven,
lighted his torch at the chariot of the sun, and brought down
fire to man.  With this, man was more than equal to all other
animals.  Fire enabled him to make weapons to subdue wild beasts,
tools with which to till the earth.  With fire he warmed his
dwelling and bid defiance to the cold.</p>

<p id="id00147">Woman was not yet made.  The story is, that Jupiter made her, and
sent her to Prometheus and his brother, to punish them for their
presumption in stealing fire from heaven; and man, for accepting
the gift.  The first woman was named Pandora.  She was made in
heaven, every god contributing something to perfect her.  Venus
gave her beauty, Mercury persuasion, Apollo music.  Thus
equipped, she was conveyed to earth, and presented to Epimetheus,
who gladly accepted her, though cautioned by his brother to
beware of Jupiter and his gifts.  Epimetheus had in his house a
jar, in which were kept certain noxious articles, for which, in
fitting man for his new abode, he had had no occasion.  Pandora
was seized with an eager curiosity to know what this jar
contained; and one day she slipped off the cover and looked in.
Forthwith there escaped a multitude of plagues for hapless man,—
such as gout, rheumatism, and colic for his body, and envy,
spite, and revenge for his mind,— and scattered themselves far
and wide.  Pandora hastened to replace the lid; but, alas! The
whole contents of the jar had escaped, one thing only excepted,
which lay at the bottom, and that was HOPE.  So we see at this
day, whatever evils are abroad, hope never entirely leaves us;
and while we have THAT, no amount of other ills can make us
completely wretched.</p>

<p id="id00148">Another story is, that Pandora was sent in good faith, by
Jupiter, to bless man; that she was furnished with a box,
containing her marriage presents, into which every god had put
some blessing.  She opened the box incautiously, and the
blessings all escaped, HOPE only excepted.  This story seems more
consistent than the former; for how could HOPE, so precious a
jewel as it is, have been kept in a jar full of all manner of
evils?</p>

<p id="id00149">The world being thus furnished with inhabitants, the first age
was an age of innocence and happiness, called the GOLDEN AGE.
Truth and right prevailed, though not enforced by law, nor was
there any magistrate to threaten or punish.  The forest had not
yet been robbed of its trees to furnish timbers for vessels, nor
had men built fortifications round their towns.  There were no
such things as swords, spears, or helmets.  The earth brought
forth all things necessary for man, without his labor in
ploughing or sowing.  Perpetual spring reigned, flowers sprang up
without seed, the rivers flowed with milk and wine, and yellow
honey distilled from the oaks.</p>

<p id="id00150">  "But when good Saturn, banished from above,<br/>

  Was driven to hell, the world was under Jove.<br/>

  Succeeding times a Silver Age behold,<br/>

  Excelling brass, but more excelled by gold.<br/>

  Then summer, autumn, winter did appear,<br/>

  And spring was but a season of the year.<br/>

  The sun his annual course obliquely made,<br/>

  Good days contracted and enlarged the bad,<br/>

  Then air, with sultry heats, began to glow;<br/>

  The wings of winds were clogged with ice and sno<br/>

  And shivering mortals into houses driven,<br/>

  Sought shelter from the inclemency of heaven.<br/>

  Those houses then were caves, or homely sheds;<br/>

  With twining osiers fenced; and moss their beds.<br/>

  Then ploughs, for seed, the fruitful furrows broke,<br/>

  And oxen labored first beneath the yoke.<br/>

  To this came next in course the Brazen Age:<br/>

  A warlike offspring, prompt to bloody rage,<br/>

  Not impious yet! . .<br/>

  . . . Hard Steel succeeded then;<br/>

  And stubborn as the metal were the men."<br/>

  Ovid's Metam, Book I.  Dryden's Translation.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00151">Crime burst in like a flood; modesty, truth, and honor fled.  In
their places came fraud and cunning, violence, and the wicked
love of gain.  Then seamen spread sails to the wind, and the
trees were torn from the mountains to serve for keels to ships,
and vex the face of ocean.  The earth, which till now had been
cultivated in common, began to be divided off into possessions.
Men were not satisfied with what the surface produced, but must
dig into its bowels, and draw forth from thence the ores of
metals.  Mischievous IRON, and more mischievous GOLD, were
produced.  War sprang up, using both as weapons; the guest was
not safe in his friend's house; and sons-in-law and fathers-in-
law, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives, could not trust
one another.  Sons wished their fathers dead, that they might
come to the inheritance; family love lay prostrate.  The earth
was wet with slaughter, and the gods abandoned it, one by one,
till Astraea [the goddess of innocence and purity.  After leaving
earth, she was placed among the stars, where she became the
constellation Virgo  The Virgin.  Themis (Justice) was the mother
of Astraea.  She is represented as holding aloft a pair of
scales, in which she weighs the claims of opposing parties.  It
was a favorite idea of the old poets, that these goddesses would
one day return, and bring back the Golden Age.  Even in a
Christian Hymn, the Messiah of Pope, this idea occurs.</p>

<p id="id00152">  "All crimes shall cease, and ancient fraud shall fail,<br/>

  Returning Justice lift aloft her scale,<br/>

  Peace o'er the world her olive wand extend,<br/>

  And white-robed Innocence from heaven descend."  See, also,<br/>

  Milton's Hymn on the nativity, stanzas xiv, and xv] alone was<br/>

      left, and finally she also took her departure.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00153">Jupiter, seeing this state of things, burned with anger.  He
summoned the gods to council.  They obeyed the call, and took
The road to the palace of heaven.  The road, which any one may
see in a clear night, stretches across the face of the sky, and
is called the Milky Way.  Along the road stand the palaces of the
illustrious gods; the common people of the skies live apart, on
either side.  Jupiter addressed the assembly.  He set forth the
frightful condition of things on the earth, and closed by
announcing his intention to destroy the whole of its inhabitants,
and provide a new race, unlike the first, who would be more
worthy of life, and much better worshippers of   the gods.  So
saying he took a thunderbolt, and was about to launch it at the
world, and destroy it by burning it; but recollecting the danger
that such a conflagration might set heaven itself on fire, he
changed his plan, and resolved to drown the world.  Aquilo, the
north wind, which scatters the clouds, was chained up; Notus, the
south, was sent out, and soon covered all the face of heaven with
a cloak of pitchy darkness.  The clouds, driven together, resound
with a crash; torrents of rain fall; the crops are laid low; the
year's labor of the husbandman perishes in an hour.  Jupiter, not
satisfied with his own waters, calls on his brother Neptune to
aid him with his.  He lets loose the rivers, and pours them over
the land.  At the same time, he heaves the land with an
earthquake, and brings in the reflux of the ocean over the
shores.  Flocks, herds, men, and houses are swept away, and
temples, with their sacred enclosures, profaned.  If any edifice
remained standing, it was overwhelmed, and its turrets lay hid
beneath the waves.  Now all was sea; sea without shore.  Here and
there some one remained on a projecting hill-top, and a few, in
boats, pulled the oar where they had lately driven the plough.
The fishes swim among the tree-tops; the anchor is let down into
a garden.  Where the graceful lambs played but now, unwieldy sea-
calves gambol.  The wolf swims among the sheep; the yellow lions
and tigers struggle in the water.  The strength of the wild boar
serves him not, nor his swiftness the stag.  The birds fall with
weary wing into the water, having found no land for a resting
place.  Those living beings whom the water spared fell a prey to
hunger.</p>

<p id="id00154">Parnassus alone, of all the mountains, overtopped the waves; and
there Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha, of the race of Prometheus,
found refuge   he a just man, and she a faithful worshipper of
the gods.  Jupiter, when he saw none left alive but this pair,
and remembered their harmless lives and pious demeanor, ordered
the north winds to drive away the clouds, and disclose the skies
to earth, and earth to the skies.  Neptune also directed Triton
to blow on his shell, and sound a retreat to the waters.  The
waters obeyed, and the sea returned to its shores, and the rivers
to their channels.  Then Deucalion thus addressed Pyrrha: "O
wife, only surviving woman, joined to me first by the ties of
kindred and marriage, and now by a common danger, would that we
possessed the power of our ancestor Prometheus, and could renew
the race as he at first made it!  But as we cannot, let us seek
yonder temple, and inquire of the gods what remains for us to
do."  They entered the temple, deformed as it was with slime, and
approached the altar, where no fire burned.  There they fell
prostrate on the earth, and prayed the goddess to inform them how
they might retrieve their miserable affairs.  The oracle
answered, "Depart from the temple with head veiled and garments
unbound, and cast behind you the bones of your mother."  They
heard the words with astonishment.  Pyrrha first broke silence:
"We cannot obey; we dare not profane the remains of our parents."
They sought the thickest shades of the wood, and revolved the
oracle in their minds.  At length Deucalion spoke: "Either my
sagacity deceives me, or the command is one we may obey without
impiety.  The earth is the great parent of all; the stones are
her bones; these we may cast behind us; and I think this is what
the oracle means.  At least, it will do no harm to try."  They
veiled their faces, unbound their garments, and picked up stones,
and cast them behind them.  The stones (wonderful to relate)
began to grow soft, and assume shape.  By degrees, they put on a
rude resemblance to the human form, like a block half finished in
the hands of the sculptor.  The moisture and slime that were
about them became flesh; the stony part became bones; the veins
remained veins, retaining their name, only changing their use.
Those thrown by the hand of the man became men, and those by the
woman became women.  It was a hard race, and well adapted to
labor, as we find ourselves to be at this day, giving plain
indications of our origin.</p>

<p id="id00155">The comparison of Eve to Pandora is too obvious to have escaped<br/>

Milton, who introduces it in Book IV, of Paradise Lost:—<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00156">  "More lovely than Pandora, whom the gods<br/>

  Endowed with all their gifts; and O, too like<br/>

  In sad event, when to the unwiser son<br/>

  Of Jupiter, brought by Hermes, she ensnared<br/>

</p>

<p id="id00157">Prometheus and Epimetheus were sons of Iapetus, which Milton
changes to Japhet.</p>

<p id="id00158">Prometheus, the Titan son of Iapetus and Themis, is a favorite
subject with the poets.  AEschylus wrote three tragedies on the
subjects of his confinement, his release, and his worship at
Athens.  Of these only the first is preserved, the Prometheus
Bound.  Prometheus was the only one in the council of the gods
who favored man.  He alone was kind to the human race, and taught
and protected them.</p>

<p id="id00159">  "I formed his mind,<br/>

  And through the cloud of barbarous ignorance<br/>

  Diffused the beams of knowledge . . . .<br/>

  They saw indeed, they heard, but what availed<br/>

  Or sight or hearing, all things round them rolling,<br/>

  Like the unreal imagery of dreams<br/>

  In wild confusion mixed!  The lightsome wall<br/>

  Of finer masonry, the raftered roof<br/>

  They knew not; but like ants still buried, delved<br/>

  Deep in the earth and scooped their sunless caves.<br/>

  Unmarked the seasons ranged, the biting winter,<br/>

  The flower-perfumed spring, the ripening summer<br/>

  Fertile of fruits.  At random all their works<br/>

  Till I instructed them to mark the stars,<br/>

  Their rising, and, a harder science yet,<br/>

  Their setting.  The rich train of marshalled numbers<br/>

  I taught them, and the meet array of letters.<br/>

  To impress these precepts on their hearts I sent<br/>

  Memory, the active mother of all reason.<br/>

  I taught the patient steer to bear the yoke,<br/>

  In all his toils joint-laborer of man.<br/>

  By me the harnessed steed was trained to whirl<br/>

  The rapid car, and grace the pride of wealth.<br/>

  The tall bark, lightly bounding o'er the waves,<br/>

  I taught its course, and winged its flying sail.<br/>

  To man I gave these arts."<br/>

  Potter's Translation from the Prometheus Bound<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00160">Jupiter, angry at the insolence and presumption of Prometheus in
taking upon himself to give all these blessings to man, condemned
the Titan to perpetual imprisonment, bound on a rock on Mount
Caucasus while a vulture should forever prey upon his liver.
This state of torment might at any time have been brought to an
end by Prometheus if he had been willing to submit to his
oppressor.  For Prometheus knew of a fatal marriage which Jove
must make and by which he must come to ruin.  Had Prometheus
revealed this secret he would at once have been taken into favor.
But this he disdained to do.  He has therefore become the symbol
of magnanimous endurance of unmerited suffering and strength of
will resisting oppression.</p>

<p id="id00161">Byron and Shelley have both treated this theme.  The following
are Byron's lines:—</p>

<p id="id00162">  "Titan!  To whose immortal eyes<br/>

  The sufferings of mortality,<br/>

  Seen in their sad reality,<br/>

  Were not as things that gods despise,<br/>

  What was thy pity's recompense?<br/>

  A silent suffering, and intense;<br/>

  The rock, the vulture, and the chain;<br/>

  All that the proud can feel of pain;<br/>

  The agony they do not show;<br/>

  The suffocating sense of woe.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00163">  "Thy godlike crime was to be kind;<br/>

  To render with thy precepts less<br/>

  The sum of human wretchedness,<br/>

  And strengthen man with his own mind.<br/>

  And, baffled as thou wert from high,<br/>

  Still, in thy patient energy,<br/>

  In the endurance and repulse,<br/>

  Of thine impenetrable spirit,<br/>

  Which earth and heaven could not convulse,<br/>

  A mighty lesson we inherit."<br/>
</p>

<h3 id="id00164" style="margin-top: 3em">PYTHON</h3>

<p id="id00165">The slime with which the earth was covered by the waters of the
flood, produced an excessive fertility, which called forth every
variety of production, both bad and good.  Among the rest,
Python, an enormous serpent, crept forth, the terror of the
people, and lurked in the caves of Mount Parnassus.  Apollo slew
him with his arrows   weapons which he had not before used
against any but feeble animals, hares, wild goats, and such game.
In commemoration of this illustrious conquest he instituted the
Pythian games, in which the victor in feats of strength,
swiftness of foot, or in the chariot race, was crowned with a
wreath of beech leaves; for the laurel was not yet adopted by
Apollo as his own tree.  And here Apollo founded his oracle at
Delphi, the only oracle "that was not exclusively national, for
it was consulted by many outside nations, and, in fact, was held
in the highest repute all over the world.  In obedience to its
decrees, the laws of Lycurgus were introduced, and the earliest
Greek colonies founded.  No cities were built without first
consulting the Delphic oracle, for it was believed that Apollo
took special delight in the founding of cities, the first stone
of which he laid in person; nor was any enterprise ever
undertaken without inquiry at this sacred fane as to its probable
success" [From Beren's Myths and Legends of Greece and Rome.]</p>

<p id="id00166">The famous statue of Apollo called the Belvedere [From the
Belvedere of the Vatican palace where it stands] represents the
god after his victory over the serpent Python.  To this Byron
alludes in his Childe Harold, iv. 161:—</p>

<p id="id00167">  "The lord of the unerring bow,<br/>

  The god of life, and poetry, and light,<br/>

  The Sun, in human limbs arrayed, and brow<br/>

  All radiant from his triumph in the fight.<br/>

  The shaft has just been shot; the arrow bright<br/>

  With an immortal's vengeance; in his eye<br/>

  And nostril, beautiful disdain, and might,<br/>

  And majesty flash their full lightnings by,<br/>

  Developing in that one glance the Deity."<br/>
</p>

<h4 id="id00168" style="margin-top: 2em">APOLLO AND DAPHNE</h4>

<p id="id00169">Daphne was Apollo's first love.  It was not brought about by
accident, but by the malice of Cupid.  Apollo saw the boy playing
with his bow and arrows; and being himself elated with his recent
victory over Python, he said to him, "What have you to do with
warlike weapons, saucy boy?  Leave them for hands worthy of them.
Behold the conquest I have won by means of them over the vast
serpent who stretched his poisonous body over acres of the plain!
Be content with your torch, child, and kindle up your flames, as
you call them, where you will, but presume not to meddle with my
weapons."</p>

<p id="id00170">Venus's boy heard these words, and rejoined, ":Your arrows may
strike all things else, Apollo, but mine shall strike you.:" So
saying, he took his stand on a rock of Parnassus, and drew from
his quiver two arrows of different workmanship, one to excite
love, the other to repel it.  The former was of gold and sharp-
pointed, the latter blunt and tipped with lead.  With the leaden
shaft he struck the nymph Daphne, the daughter of the river god
Peneus, and with the golden one Apollo, through the heart.
Forthwith the god was seized with love for the maiden, and she
abhorred the thought of loving.  Her delight was in woodland
sports and in the spoils of the chase.  Many lovers sought her,
but she spurned them all, ranging the woods, and taking thought
neither of Cupid nor of Hymen.  Her father often said to her,
"Daughter, you owe me a son-in-law; you owe me grandchildren."
She, hating the thought of marriage as a crime, with her
beautiful face tinged all over with blushes, threw her arms
around her father's neck, and said, "Dearest father, grant me
this favor, that I may always remain unmarried, like Diana."  He
consented, but at the same time said, "Your own face will forbid
it."</p>

<p id="id00171">Apollo loved her, and longed to obtain her; and he who gives
oracles to all in the world was not wise enough to look into his
own fortunes.  He saw her hair flung loose over her shoulders,
and said, "If so charming in disorder, what would it be if
arranged?"  He saw her eyes bright as stars; he saw her lips, and
was not satisfied with only seeing them.  He admired her hands
and arms bared to the shoulder, and whatever was hidden from view
he imagined more beautiful still.  He followed her; she fled,
swifter than the wind, and delayed not a moment at his
entreaties.  "Stay," said he, "daughter of Peneus; I am not a
foe.  Do not fly me as a lamb flies the wolf, or a dove the hawk.
It is for love I pursue you.  You make me miserable, for fear you
should fall and hurt yourself on these stones, and I should be
the cause.  Pray run slower, and I will follow slower.  I am no
clown, no rude peasant.  Jupiter is my father, and I am lord of
Delphos and Tenedos, and know all things, present and future.  I
am the god of song and the lyre.  My arrows fly true to the mark;
but alas!  An arrow more fatal than mine has pierced my heart!  I
am the god of medicine, and know the virtues of all healing
plants.  Alas!  I suffer a malady that no balm can cure!"</p>

<p id="id00172">The nymph continued her flight, and left his plea half uttered.
And even as she fled she charmed him.  The wind blew her
garments, and her unbound hair streamed loose behind her.  The
god grew impatient to find his wooings thrown away, and, sped by
Cupid, gained upon her in the race.  It was like a hound pursuing
a hare, with open jaws ready to seize, while the feebler animal
darts forward, slipping from the very grasp.  So flew the god and
the virgin   he on the wings of love, and she on those of fear.
The pursuer is the more rapid, however, and gains upon her, and
his panting breath blows upon her hair.  Now her strength begins
to fail, and, ready to sink, she calls upon her father, the river
god: "Help me, Peneus!  Open the earth to enclose me, or change
my form, which has brought me into this danger!"</p>

<p id="id00173">Scarcely had she spoken, when a stiffness seized all her limbs;
her bosom began to be enclosed in a tender bark; her hair became
leaves; her arms became branches; her feet stuck fast in the
ground, as roots; her face became a tree-top, retaining nothing
of its former self but its beauty.  Apollo stood amazed.  He
touched the stem, and felt the flesh tremble under the new bark.
He embraced the branches, and lavished kisses on the wood.  The
branches shrank from his lips.  "Since you cannot be my wife,"
said he, "you shall assuredly be my tree.  I will wear you for my
crown.  With you I will decorate my harp and my quiver; and when
the great Roman conquerors lead up the triumphal pomp to the
Capitol, you shall be woven into wreaths for their brows.  And,
as eternal youth is mine, you also shall be always green, and
your leaf know no decay."  The nymph, now changed into a laurel
tree, bowed its head in grateful acknowledgment.</p>

<p id="id00174">Apollo was god of music and of poetry and also of medicine.  For,
as the poet Armstrong says, himself a physician:—</p>

<p id="id00175">  "Music exalts each joy, allays each grief,<br/>

  Expels disease, softens every pain;<br/>

  And hence the wise of ancient days adored<br/>

  One power of physic, melody, and song."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00176">The story of Apollo and Daphne is often alluded to by the poets.
Waller applies it to the case of one whose amatory verses, though
they did not soften the heart of his mistress, yet won for the
poet wide-spread fame.</p>

<p id="id00177">  "Yet what he sung in his immortal strain,<br/>

  Though unsuccessful, was not sung in vain.<br/>

  All but the nymph that should redress his wrong,<br/>

  Attend his passion and approve his song.<br/>

  Like Phoebus thus, acquiring unsought praise,<br/>

  He caught at love and filled his arms with bays."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00178">The following stanza from Shelley's Adonais alludes to Byron's
early quarrel with the reviewers:—</p>

<p id="id00179">  "The herded wolves, bold only to pursue;<br/>

  The obscene ravens, clamorous o'er the dead;<br/>

  The vultures, to the conqueror's banner true,<br/>

  Who feed where Desolation first has fed.<br/>

  And whose wings rain contagion; how they fled,<br/>

  When like Apollo, from his golden bow,<br/>

  The Pythian of the age one arrow sped<br/>

  And smiled!  The spoilers tempt no second blow;<br/>

  They fawn on the proud feet that spurn them as they go."<br/>
</p>

<h3 id="id00180" style="margin-top: 3em">PYRAMUS AND THISBE</h3>

<p id="id00181">Pyramus was the handsomest youth, and Thisbe the fairest maiden,
in all Babylonia, where Semiramis reigned.  Their parents
occupied adjoining houses; and neighborhood brought the young
people together, and acquaintance ripened into love.  They would
gladly have married, but their parents forbade.  One thing,
however, they could not forbid   that love should glow with equal
ardor in the bosoms of both.  They conversed by signs and
glances, and the fire burned more intensely for being covered up.
In the wall that parted the two houses there was a crack, caused
by some fault in the structure.  No one had remarked it before,
but the lovers discovered it.  'What will love not discover?  It
afforded a passage to the voice; and tender messages used to pass
backward and forward through the gap.  As they stood, Pyramus on
this side, Thisbe on that, their breaths would mingle.  "Cruel
wall," they said, "why do you keep two lovers apart?  But we will
not be ungrateful.  We owe you, we confess, the privilege of
transmitting loving words to willing ears."  Such words they
uttered on different sides of the wall; and when night came and
they must say farewell, they pressed their lips upon the wall,
she on her side, he on his, as they could come no nearer.</p>

<p id="id00182">One morning, when Aurora had put out the stars, and the sun had
melted the frost from the grass, they met at the accustomed spot.
Then, after lamenting their hard fate, they agreed that next
night, when all was still, they would slip away from watchful
eyes, leave their dwellings and walk out into the fields; and to
insure a meeting, repair to a well-known edifice, standing
without the city's bounds, called the tomb of Ninus, and that the
one who came first should await the other at the foot of a
certain tree.  It was a white mulberry tree and stood near a cool
spring.  All was agreed on, and they waited impatiently for the
sun to go down beneath the waters and night to rise up from them.
Then cautiously Thisbe stole forth, unobserved by the family, her
head covered with a veil, made her way to the monument and sat
down under the tree.  As she sat alone in the dim light of the
evening she descried a lioness, her jaws reeking with recent
slaughter, approaching the fountain to slake her thirst.  Thisbe
fled at the sight, and sought refuge in the hollow of a rock.  As
she fled she dropped her veil.  The lioness, after drinking at
the spring, turned to retreat to the woods, and seeing the veil
on the ground, tossed and rent it with her bloody mouth.</p>

<p id="id00183">Pyramus, having been delayed, now approached the place of
meeting.  He saw in the sand the footsteps of the lion, and the
color fled from his cheeks at the sight.  Presently he found the
veil all rent and bloody.  "Oh, hapless girl," said he, "I have
been the cause of thy death!  Thou, more worthy of life than I,
hast fallen the first victim.  I will follow.  I am the guilty
cause, in tempting thee forth to a place of such peril, and not
being myself on the spot to guard thee.  Come forth, ye lions,
from the rocks, and tear this guilty body with your teeth" He
took up the veil, carried it with him to the appointed tree, and
covered it with kisses and with tears.  "My blood also shall
stain your texture," said he, and drawing his sword plunged it
into his heart.  The blood spurted from the wound, and tinged the
white mulberries of the tree all red; and sinking into the earth
reached the roots, so that the red color mounted through the
trunk to the fruit.</p>

<p id="id00184">By this time, Thisbe, still trembling with fear, yet wishing not
to disappoint her lover, stepped cautiously forth, looking
anxiously for the youth, eager to tell him the danger she had
escaped.  When she came to the spot and saw the changed color of
the mulberries she doubted whether it was the same place.  While
she hesitated she saw the form of one struggling in the agonies
of death.  She started back, a shudder ran through her frame as a
ripple on the face of the still water when a sudden breeze sweeps
over it.  But as soon as she recognized her lover, she screamed
and beat her breast; embracing the lifeless body, pouring tears
into its wounds, and imprinting kisses on the cold lips.  "Oh,
Pyramus," she cried, "what has done this?  Answer me, Pyramus; it
is your own Thisbe that speaks.  Hear me, dearest, and lift that
drooping head!"  At the name of Thisbe, Pyramus opened his eyes,
then closed them again.  She saw her veil stained with blood and
the scabbard empty of its sword.  "Thy own hand has slain thee,
and for my sake," she said.  "I too can be brave for once, and my
love is as strong as thine.  I will follow thee in death, for I
have been the cause; and death, which alone could part us, shall
not prevent my joining thee.  And ye, unhappy parents of us both,
deny us not our united request.  As love and death have joined
us, let one tomb contain us.  And thou, tree, retain the marks of
slaughter.  Let thy berries still serve for memorials of our
blood."  So saying, she plunged the sword into her breast.  Her
parents acceded to her wish; the gods also ratified it.  The two
bodies were buried in one sepulchre, and the tree ever after
brought forth purple berries, as it does to this day.</p>

<p id="id00185">Moore, in the Sylph's Ball, speaking of Davy's Safety Lamp, is
reminded of the wall that separated Thisbe and her lover:—</p>

<p id="id00186">  "O for that lamp's metallic gauze,<br/>

  That curtain of protecting wire,<br/>

  Which Davy delicately draws<br/>

  Around illicit, dangerous fire!<br/>
