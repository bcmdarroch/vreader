# VReader

VReader is my capstone project for [Ada Developers Academy](http://adadevelopersacademy.org/), Cohort 7.

# Problem Statement

VR/AR is the next frontier for consuming media. I'm curious about what that future looks like. What capabilities of VR can we leverage to enhance activities we enjoy now?

For example, how could VR change how I read? How could it improve upon the e-reader? To explore these ideas, I decided to create the VReader, an app that enables the user to comfortably read a book while surrounded by an environment reflecting the setting of the story.

# Technologies
* [LÃ–VR](http://lovr.org/) (Lua VR framework)

# Functionality

* An instruction guide can be found on the wall in the environment
* Touching the active book page and holding down the trigger allows you to move and rotate the book page
* While the trigger is held, scrolling on the y-axis of the touchpad allows you to scale the text
* Releasing the trigger saves any movement or scale change
* Side grip buttons inverse the text display colors
* Touching another book and pressing the menu button switches the selected book to the active book
* Pick a book, position it just right, and read away!
