# VReader

VReader is my capstone project for [Ada Developers Academy](http://adadevelopersacademy.org/), Cohort 7.

# Problem Statement

VR/AR is the next frontier for consuming media. I'm curious about what that future looks like. What capabilities of VR can we leverage to enhance activities we enjoy now?

For example, how could VR change how I read? How could it improve upon the e-reader? To explore these ideas, I decided to create the VReader, an app that enables the user to comfortably read a book while surrounded by an environment reflecting the setting of the story.
